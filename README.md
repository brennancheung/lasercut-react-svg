The idea behind this project is to generate SVG dynamically for various
manufacturing purposes.  Initially this is laser cutting but it can also be
for CNC and 3D printing.

I had difficult using various vector applications to create designs due to
the lack of ability to create parts of the design programatically.  It was
very error prone and tedious.

Using dynamic code to generate the designs makes reusable patterns much
easier.
